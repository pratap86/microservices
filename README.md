# Curcuit Breaker
- Microservice1 -> Microservice2 -> Microservice3 -> Microservice4 -> Microservice5
  - what if one of the above service is slow or down?
    - impact entire chain?
  - Questions?
    - Can we return a fallback response if a service is down?
    - Can we implement a circuit breaker pattern to reduce the load?
    - Can we retry the request in case of temporary failures?
    - Can we implemnt rete limiting?
  - Solution : Circuit Breaker Framework - <b>Resilience4j</b>
  - CircuitBreaker is implemented via a finite state machine with three normal states: CLOSED, OPEN and HALF_OPEN
