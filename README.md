|`Latest version of Spring Boot & Cloud`| 1. Spring Cloud LoadBalencer instead of Ribbon<br>netflix eureka client comes with spring cloud load balencer<br>2. Spring Cloud Gateway instead of Zuul<br>3. Resilience4j instead of Hystrix |
|`Docker Containerize microservices`|Run microservices using Docker & Docker Compose|
|`Kubernetes`|Orchestrate all your microservices with Kubernetes|

- Currency Conversion Microservice talks to Currency Exchange Microservice

- Microservices URLs before implementing custom routing

|Microservice|URL|
|---|---|
|`CURRENCY-EXCHANGE`|http://localhost:8765/currency-exchange/currency-exchange/from/USD/to/INR|
|`CURRENCY-CONVERSION`|http://localhost:8765/currency-conversion/currency-conversion/resttemplate/from/USD/to/INR/quantity/10|

# Curcuit Breaker
- Microservice1 -> Microservice2 -> Microservice3 -> Microservice4 -> Microservice5
  - what if one of the above service is slow or down?
    - impact entire chain?
  - Questions?
    - Can we return a fallback response if a service is down?
    - Can we implement a circuit breaker pattern to reduce the load?
    - Can we retry the request in case of temporary failures?
    - Can we implemnt rete limiting?
  - Solution : Circuit Breaker Framework - <b>Resilience4j</b>
  - CircuitBreaker is implemented via a finite state machine with three normal states: CLOSED, OPEN and HALF_OPEN

# HTTP Status Codes

|`400-level (Client error)`|`Client sent an invalid request`|
|`500-level (Server error)`|`Server failed to fulfill a valid request due to an error with server`|

## Docker

- Enterprises are heading towrds microservices architecture
  - Build small focused microservices
  - Flexibility to innovate and build applications in different programming languages like Go, Java, Python, JavaScript..
  - but deployment becomes complex!
  - How we can have one way of deploying  Go, Java, Python, JavaScript ... microservices?
    - Enter Containers!
  - Docker
    - create docker image for each microservices
    - Docker image contains everything a microservice needs to run
      - Application Runtime (JDK, Python or NodeJS)
      - Application code
      - Dependencies
    - You can run these docker containers the same way on any infrastructure
      - local machine
      - Corporate data center
      - Cloud
    - Default Registry(hub.docker.com) > Repository(narayanpratap86/todo-rest-api-h2) > Tag(1.0.0.RELEASE)
    - A docker image a static version like a class, while a dynamic version of a docker image is called container like an Object
